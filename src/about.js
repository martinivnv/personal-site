				<p>
					When I was around 9 or 10 years old, I learned about computer
					programming from a movie called <em>War Games</em> and I was
					immediately fascinated. The very next day, I headed to the library and
					took out a book about Ruby for beginners. I read it cover to cover in
					a day or two â€” without writing a single line of code! Despite my best
					efforts, I couldn't get Ruby to work on my family's computer, but I
					was so engrossed in understanding the logic of the programs detailed
					in the book that I devoured it like a <em>Harry Potter</em> novel.
